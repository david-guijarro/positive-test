- The requirement is to create a bookstore website that lists a number of books, with the ability to view information about each book.
- The application should be built using .Net 7
- The home page of the application should contain a simple list of a maximum of 10 books
- Clicking the book title will navigate the user to a page that lists the information regarding that book
- The book data should be stored in a Kontent.ai instance (you can sign up to a free developer license)
- We are not concerned with the presentation of the website, so donâ€™t worry about styling the front end.

Time limit is 3 hours.
